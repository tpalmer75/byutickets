          <h3>Season</h3>
          <h4>June Renewal</h4>
          <p>Previous (2012-13) Season Ticket holders (except those seated in Courtside and rows 1-7 of Sections 20, 21 & 22) will have the opportunity to renew their 2012-13 seats, to release seats they are not renewing, and to pay for those seats during a June Seat Renewal online process. The renewal of previous seats and payment for them will happen exclusively from June 12th through June 23rd. No time slot is needed, however customers will be provided with their customer number and seat selection PIN to log into their account at the Seats 3D BYU website. 
            <u><i>Payment must be received during the June renewal period.</i></u> The deadline is June 23, 2013 @ 5:00pm
          </p>
          <p> 
            <u><i>Payment for 2013-14 season tickets must be received during the June renewal period; if you are paying on-line you will also need your account password. </i></u> If you do not remember your password, have not yet set up a password, or need any other assistance, please call the BYU Ticket Office (801-422-2981).
            <u> <i>Season tickets that are not purchased by June 23 will be released to be selected by other patrons during the Upgrade/Change in July.</i></u>
          </p>
          <h4>July Upgrade</h4>
          <p>
            <u><i>Every season ticket holder who renews and purchases their season tickets in June will be offered a unique time slot </i></u>and the opportunity to change/upgrade their current seating location and/or add to the number of season tickets that they have previously purchased. All available seating released during June will be available for upgrades during the July period. Customers will use the Seats 3D software introduced last year to select their changes and upgrades. Cougar Club Members who did not purchase season tickets in 2012-13 must request a timeslot (prior to June 24th) in order to choose season ticket locations for 2013-14. Customers in rows 1-7 of Sections 20, 21 & 22 will be included in the upgrade period in July.
          </p>
          <p>Many seating locations in the lower bowl are dependent on maintaining your Cougar Club membership.  If you were a Cougar Club member last year when you chose your seats (in the lower bowl), you must maintain that level of membership or higher to keep your seating location. Please be sure that your Cougar Club membership remains active. If you are no longer active at the required level, your seats will be released and you will have the opportunity to choose a new location.</p>
          <p>Time slots will be assigned from July 9th through July 22nd; this information will be mailed and emailed to each customer. Changing seats is optional. Many customers will complete their renewal process in June and not need to log into the system a second time if they are satisfied with their current seating location. Unique selection times will begin with Cougar Club Donors, based on Cougar Club membership level <a href="http://cougarclub.com/info">(see Cougar Club)</a>, and then on priority points. Priority Points are given for the following:</p>
          <li>1 point for each dollar donated to the Cougar Club</li>
          <li>100 points for each year of continuous season ticket purchase for football and men's basketball</li>
          <li>500 points for each East Club seat ever purchased (football)</li>
          <li>1000 points for each Legacy Club seat ever purchased (football)</li>
          <li>1000 points for each Courtside seat ever purchased (men's basketball)</li>
